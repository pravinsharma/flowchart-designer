## File Structure

```
flowchart-designer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # All styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shapes.js           # Shape classes and definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ canvas.js           # Canvas controller and rendering

```

## Customization

### Adding New Shapes

Edit `shapes.js` to add new shape classes:

```javascript
class MyCustomShape extends Shape {
    drawShape(ctx) {
        // Your custom drawing code
        ctx.beginPath();
        // ... draw your shape
        ctx.fill();
        ctx.stroke();
    }
}
```

Then add to the palette in `index.html`:

```html
<div class="shape-item" data-shape="custom" title="Custom Shape">
    <div class="shape-preview"><!-- preview --></div>
    <span>Custom</span>
</div>
```

And register in `canvas.js` `createShape` method:

```javascript
const shapeMap = {
    // ... existing shapes
    'custom': MyCustomShape
};
```

### Changing Colors

Edit `styles.css` to customize the UI:

```css
/* Change header gradient */
.header {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #your-color-1, #your-color-2);
}

/* Change selection handles color */
.handle {
    background: #your-color;
}
```

### Adding Keyboard Shortcuts

Edit `app.js` in the `setupKeyboardShortcuts` method:

```javascript
if (e.key === 'your-key') {
    // Your action
}
```

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Precise Positioning
- Use the properties panel to enter exact X, Y coordinates
- Connector snapping to connection points (15px snap distance)
- Grid snapping for perfect alignment (toggle with G key)
- Alignment guidelines for multi-shape layouts (toggle with L key)

### 2. Quick Duplication
- Right-click ‚Üí Duplicate
- Or copy the shape using Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V (coming soon)

### 3. Alignment
- Use grid snapping (G) for consistent spacing
- Enable guidelines (L) for automatic alignment detection
- Visual magenta lines show alignment opportunities
- Select multiple shapes (coming soon)
- Advanced alignment tools (coming soon)

### 4. Templates
- Save common diagrams as JSON
- Load as starting point for new diagrams

### 5. Professional Look
- Use consistent colors across shapes
- Align shapes properly
- Use appropriate fonts and sizes
- Keep adequate spacing

### 6. Working with Connectors
- **8 Connection Points**: Each shape has 8 connection points (top, right, bottom, left, and corners)
- **Visual Feedback**: Connection points light up when you're close enough to snap
- **Smart Movement**: Connected shapes automatically update connector positions
- **Flexible Editing**: Drag connector endpoints to reconnect to different shapes

## Known Limitations

- No shape grouping (coming soon)
- No auto-routing for connectors (coming soon)
- Cannot resize multiple shapes simultaneously (single shape only)
- Connectors don't avoid overlapping shapes (manual routing)
- SVG export is one-way (cannot re-import SVG files)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [x] Multi-select with Shift+Click
- [x] Box select (drag rectangle to select multiple)
- [ ] Shape grouping and ungrouping
- [x] Alignment tools (align left, center, right, etc.)
- [x] Distribution tools (space evenly)
- [x] Grid snapping and guidelines
- [x] Smart connectors that attach to shapes
- [ ] Auto-routing for connectors (path finding)
