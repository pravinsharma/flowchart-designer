# Connector Reattachment Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the flowchart designer to allow connector endpoints (arrows and lines) to be re-attached to different connection points without needing to recreate the connector objects.

## Changes Made

### 1. **canvas.js - `resizeShape()` method**
- **Refactored connector endpoint handling** to properly support reattachment
- Now distinguishes between **endpoint handles** (start/end) and **waypoint handles**
- **Snap detection** works for any shape, not just excluding the current connector
- **Connection management**:
  - When dragging an endpoint near a connection point ‚Üí snaps and creates/updates connection
  - When dragging away from connection points ‚Üí clears connection and allows free positioning
- **Visual feedback**: Green highlight and connection points show when hovering over shapes during drag

### 2. **canvas.js - `checkConnectorEndpointClick()` method** (New!)
- **Detects clicks near connector endpoints** without requiring selection first
- Detection radius: 12 pixels (adjusts with zoom level)
- Works for both head (end) and tail (start) of connectors
- Returns connector reference and which endpoint was clicked
- Enables quick endpoint dragging workflow

### 3. **shapes.js - Arrow/Line class**
- **Updated `updateBoundingBox()` method** to recalculate offsets after endpoint changes
- Ensures proper synchronization of internal offset values (`_offsetX1`, `_offsetY1`, etc.)
- This maintains correct behavior when moving connectors after reattachment

## How It Works

### User Interaction Flow:

#### Method 1: Click Directly Near Endpoint (New! ‚ö°)
1. **Click and drag near the head or tail** of any connector (no need to select first)
2. The connector automatically gets selected and enters drag mode
3. **Drag the endpoint** to a new location
4. **Visual feedback**:
   - Green highlight appears on target shapes when near connection points
   - Blue connection points become visible on the target shape
   - Connector turns green when snapped to a connection point
5. **Release the mouse** to complete the reattachment

#### Method 2: Select Then Drag Handle (Traditional)
1. **Select a connector** (arrow or line) by clicking on its body
2. **Grab an endpoint handle** (the small squares at the start or end)
3. **Drag the handle** to a new location
4. Same visual feedback as Method 1
5. **Release the mouse** to complete the reattachment

### Technical Details:

#### Snapping Behavior:
```javascript
// Snap distance: 15px (adjusts with zoom level)
const snapResult = this.findNearestConnectionPoint(x, y, shape);
if (snapResult) {
    // Snap to connection point
    x = snapResult.point.x;
    y = snapResult.point.y;
    
    // Update connection metadata
    shape.startConnection = {
        shapeId: snapResult.shape.id,
        position: snapResult.point.position
    };
}
```

#### Connection Persistence:
- Connections are stored as metadata: `{ shapeId, position }`
- When connected shapes move, connectors automatically update via `updateConnections()`
- Connections survive save/load cycles (stored in JSON)

#### Freedom to Disconnect:
- Dragging endpoint away from all connection points clears the connection
- Allows free positioning of connector endpoints in empty space
- Connection metadata is set to `null` when disconnected

## Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented:
- [x] **Quick drag from endpoint** - Click near head/tail without selecting first ‚ö°
- [x] Drag endpoint handles to reattach to different shapes
- [x] Snap to any of 8 connection points per shape
- [x] Visual feedback (green highlight + connection points)
- [x] Support for both Arrow and Line connectors
- [x] Maintains waypoints when reattaching
- [x] Clears connections when dragging to free space
- [x] Automatic bounding box updates
- [x] Undo/Redo support (via state save)
- [x] Smart cursor changes when hovering near endpoints

### üéØ Use Cases:
1. **Reorganizing flowcharts** - reconnect arrows when moving boxes around
2. **Correcting mistakes** - easily fix wrong connections
3. **Iterative design** - experiment with different connection arrangements
4. **Rapid prototyping** - quickly rewire diagram flows

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Endpoint Drag (Recommended ‚≠ê)
```
1. Create two shapes (A and B)
2. Draw an arrow from A to B
3. Create a third shape (C)
4. Click and drag near the arrow head (at B)
5. Drag to shape C - green highlight shows when near
6. Release - arrow now connects A ‚Üí C
```

### Example 2: Traditional Selection Method
```
1. Create two shapes (A and B)
2. Draw an arrow from A to B
3. Create a third shape (C)
4. Select the arrow by clicking on it
5. Drag the endpoint handle from B to C
6. Arrow now connects A ‚Üí C
```

### Example 3: Swapping Connections
```
1. Create shapes A, B, C with arrow A ‚Üí B
2. Select the arrow
3. Drag start point from A to C
4. Arrow now connects C ‚Üí B
```

### Example 4: Disconnecting
```
1. Select a connected arrow
2. Drag endpoint away from all shapes
3. Arrow becomes disconnected (free-floating endpoint)
```

## Technical Benefits

1. **No Object Recreation**: Preserves connector identity, waypoints, and styling
2. **Efficient**: Only updates connection metadata and endpoint positions
3. **State Management**: Works seamlessly with undo/redo system
4. **Clean Code**: Centralized logic in `resizeShape()` and `checkConnectorEndpointClick()` methods
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add more connection types or rules
6. **Intuitive UX**: Direct endpoint manipulation without requiring selection first
7. **Smart Detection**: Automatically finds nearest endpoint in layered diagrams
8. **Zoom-Aware**: Detection radius adjusts based on zoom level for consistent feel

## Testing Recommendations

- Test reattachment between different shape types (Rectangle, Circle, Diamond, etc.)
- Verify waypoints remain intact during reattachment
- Test undo/redo after reattaching
- Verify save/load preserves new connections
- Test with zoomed/panned canvas
- Check that moving connected shapes updates connector positions correctly

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Show distance to connection points numerically
- [ ] Add keyboard modifier to force/prevent snapping
- [ ] Highlight valid connection points based on flowchart logic
- [ ] Add connection validation rules (e.g., no self-loops)
- [ ] Animate transition when reattaching
- [ ] Show temporary "ghost" connector during drag
